# User Roles Verification Report

## ✅ Role Assignment is Fully Functional

### Available Roles

The system supports 4 distinct user roles with hierarchical permissions:

1. **Admin** (`admin`)
   - Full system access
   - All permissions granted
   - Can manage users, devices, rates, and system settings

2. **Operator** (`operator`)
   - Device management and control
   - Rate management
   - Cost analysis
   - Cannot manage users or system settings

3. **Viewer** (`viewer`)
   - Read-only access
   - Can view devices, rates, and costs
   - Cannot make changes

4. **Guest** (`guest`)
   - Very limited access
   - Can only view devices
   - No modification capabilities

## Role Assignment Components

### Frontend Components

#### 1. User Creation Modal (`/src/components/user-create-edit-modal.tsx`)
- **Role Selection**: Dropdown with all 4 roles
- **Visual**: Each role shows label and description
- **Permissions**: Optional custom permissions can be assigned
- **Validation**: Role is required field

```tsx
const USER_ROLES = [
  { value: 'admin', label: 'Administrator', description: 'Full system access' },
  { value: 'operator', label: 'Operator', description: 'Device control and monitoring' },
  { value: 'viewer', label: 'Viewer', description: 'Read-only access' },
  { value: 'guest', label: 'Guest', description: 'Limited access' }
];
```

#### 2. User Management Page (`/src/app/admin/users/page.tsx`)
- **Role Display**: Color-coded badges for each role
  - Admin: Red badge
  - Operator: Blue badge
  - Viewer: Green badge
  - Guest: Gray badge
- **Edit Capability**: Click "Edit" to change user's role
- **Visual Feedback**: Immediate update after role change

### Backend Components

#### 1. API Endpoints (`/backend/server.py`)
- **POST /api/users**: Creates user with specified role
- **PUT /api/users/{id}**: Updates user including role
- **PATCH /api/users/{id}**: Partial update including role

#### 2. Database Layer (`/backend/database.py`)
- **create_user()**: Saves role during user creation
- **update_user()**: Allows role updates
- **Database Schema**: `role` column in users table

#### 3. Permission System (`/backend/auth.py`)
- **Automatic Mapping**: Roles automatically map to permissions
- **Permission Sets**:
  ```python
  ROLE_PERMISSIONS = {
      UserRole.ADMIN: [all 20 permissions],
      UserRole.OPERATOR: [8 permissions],
      UserRole.VIEWER: [3 permissions],
      UserRole.GUEST: [1 permission]
  }
  ```

## How Role Assignment Works

### Creating a User with Role
1. Admin opens User Management page
2. Clicks "Add User" button
3. Fills in user details
4. **Selects role from dropdown**
5. Submits form
6. Backend creates user with selected role
7. User inherits permissions based on role

### Changing a User's Role
1. Admin opens User Management page
2. Clicks "Edit" on user row
3. **Changes role in dropdown**
4. Saves changes
5. Backend updates user role
6. Permissions automatically adjust

### Role Enforcement
1. User logs in
2. JWT token includes user role
3. Each API request checks permissions
4. Frontend shows/hides features based on role
5. Backend enforces role-based access

## Testing Role Assignment

### Test Case 1: Create User with Operator Role
```bash
POST /api/users
{
  "username": "john_operator",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "full_name": "John Smith",
  "password": "password123",
  "role": "operator"
}
```
**Expected**: User created with operator role and permissions

### Test Case 2: Change Role from Viewer to Operator
```bash
PUT /api/users/3
{
  "role": "operator"
}
```
**Expected**: User's role updated, new permissions applied

### Test Case 3: Verify Role Permissions
```bash
GET /api/users
```
**Expected**: Each user shows correct role and associated permissions

## Visual Indicators

### User Table
- Role column displays colored badge
- Badge color indicates permission level
- Hover shows role description

### Edit Modal
- Dropdown shows current role selected
- All available roles listed
- Description helps admin choose appropriate role

## Security Features

1. **Role Validation**: Only valid roles accepted
2. **Permission Inheritance**: Automatic based on role
3. **Admin Protection**: First user always admin
4. **Role Downgrade**: Admin can downgrade other admins
5. **Self-Protection**: User cannot change own role

## Fixed Issues

1. **PATCH Method Support**: Added PATCH endpoint for partial updates
2. **Role Display**: Properly shows role badges in UI
3. **Permission Mapping**: Automatic permission assignment works

## Summary

✅ **Role assignment is fully functional** with:
- 4 distinct roles with clear permissions
- Visual role selection in UI
- Proper backend enforcement
- Automatic permission mapping
- Role-based access control throughout the application

The system successfully allows administrators to:
1. Assign roles during user creation
2. Change user roles after creation
3. View user roles in the management interface
4. Enforce role-based permissions on all operations
