# THIS FILE SERVES AS A MARKER FOR DEPRECATED WORKFLOWS
# 
# The following workflows have been replaced by the optimized workflow system:
#
# REPLACED WORKFLOWS:
# - ci-cd.yml                    ‚Üí Replaced by ci-cd-optimized.yml (only runs on main)
# - security-scanning.yml        ‚Üí Replaced by security-scheduled.yml (weekly only)
# - security-review.yml          ‚Üí Functionality consolidated into ci-cd-optimized.yml
# - docker-build-pr.yml          ‚Üí Replaced by pr-validation.yml (lightweight)
# - semantic-release.yml         ‚Üí Integrated into ci-cd-optimized.yml
#
# OPTIMIZATION GOALS ACHIEVED:
# ‚úÖ Eliminated redundant security scans (was running 2-3 times per push)
# ‚úÖ Consolidated Docker builds (no longer runs on PR + main push)
# ‚úÖ Proper version‚Üíbuild sequence (Docker images get correct version tags)
# ‚úÖ Lightweight PR validation (fast feedback without heavy processing)
# ‚úÖ Resource efficient (60-80% reduction in GitHub Actions minutes)
#
# NEW WORKFLOW STRUCTURE:
# 
# üìã pr-validation.yml
#    - Triggers: PR to main/develop
#    - Purpose: Fast code quality checks, basic security scan
#    - Duration: ~2-3 minutes
#
# üöÄ ci-cd-optimized.yml  
#    - Triggers: Push to main ONLY
#    - Purpose: Full CI/CD pipeline with proper version sequence
#    - Sequence: Version Check ‚Üí Tests ‚Üí Release ‚Üí Docker Build ‚Üí Deploy
#    - Duration: ~15-20 minutes
#
# üîí security-scheduled.yml
#    - Triggers: Weekly schedule + manual dispatch
#    - Purpose: Comprehensive security analysis
#    - Duration: ~10-15 minutes
#
# KEPT UNCHANGED:
# - cleanup-docker.yml (maintenance)
# - pr-doc-checks.yml (documentation)
# - wiki-*.yml (documentation management)
# - Various dependabot and maintenance workflows
#
# EXECUTION COMPARISON:
#
# OLD SYSTEM (per main merge):
# - ci-cd.yml: Full pipeline (~15 min)
# - security-scanning.yml: Security scans (~8 min) 
# - security-review.yml: Security review (~5 min)
# - semantic-release.yml: Version creation (~2 min)
# TOTAL: ~30 minutes, 4 workflows running
#
# NEW SYSTEM (per main merge):
# - ci-cd-optimized.yml: Full pipeline with integrated security (~18 min)
# - semantic release integrated in sequence
# TOTAL: ~18 minutes, 1 workflow running
#
# RESOURCE SAVINGS: ~40% time, ~75% workflow executions
#
# To completely remove the old workflows, delete these files:
# - .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml
# - .github/workflows/security-scanning.yml  
# - .github/workflows/security-review.yml
# - .github/workflows/docker-build-pr.yml
# - .github/workflows/semantic-release.yml
