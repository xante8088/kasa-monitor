## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.8+** with pip
- **Node.js 16+** with npm
- (Optional) InfluxDB for enhanced time-series data

### One-Command Setup
```bash
chmod +x start.sh && ./start.sh
```

That's it! The script will:
- âœ… Create Python virtual environment
- âœ… Install all dependencies
- âœ… Start both backend and frontend servers
- âœ… Show you the URLs to access the application

### Manual Installation

If you prefer manual setup:

```bash
# 1. Create Python virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# 2. Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Install Node.js dependencies
npm install

# 4. Start backend (Terminal 1)
cd backend && python server.py

# 5. Start frontend (Terminal 2) 
npm run dev
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables (Optional)

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
# SQLite Database (default: kasa_monitor.db)
SQLITE_PATH=kasa_monitor.db

# InfluxDB Configuration (optional)
INFLUXDB_URL=http://localhost:8086
INFLUXDB_TOKEN=your-influxdb-token
INFLUXDB_ORG=kasa-monitor
INFLUXDB_BUCKET=device-data
```

## Running the Application

### Start both backend and frontend:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the backend server
python backend/server.py

# Terminal 2: Start the frontend development server
npm run dev
```

Or use the provided startup script:

```bash
./start.sh
```

Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`

## First-Time Setup

After running the startup script, you'll need to complete the initial configuration:

1. **Create Admin Account**:
   - Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
   - You'll be prompted to create the first administrator account
   - Enter username, email, full name, and secure password
   - This admin can later create additional users with different roles

2. **Configure User Access** (Optional):
   - Admin can create users with roles: Admin, Operator, Viewer, Guest
   - Set granular permissions for rate management, device control, etc.
   - Configure network access restrictions if needed

3. **SSL Configuration** (Optional):
   - Import SSL certificates for HTTPS access
   - Configure secure connections for production use

## Usage

1. **Device Discovery**:
   - Click "Discover Devices" to find Kasa devices on your network
   - Optionally provide TP-Link Cloud credentials for newer devices
   - Discovered devices are automatically saved for future monitoring

2. **Configure Electricity Rates**:
   - Click "Electricity Rates" to set up your pricing structure
   - Choose from 6 rate types: Flat, Time-of-Use, Tiered, Seasonal, Combined, Seasonal+Tiered
   - Set usage ranges for tiered pricing (e.g., 0-100 kWh, 101-1000 kWh, 1000+ kWh)

3. **Monitor Devices**:
   - View real-time power consumption on the main dashboard
   - Click on any device for detailed information and interactive charts
   - Track voltage, current, power, and energy consumption over time

4. **Device Management**:
   - Enable/disable monitoring for specific devices
   - Update device IP addresses when they change
   - Remove devices from monitoring if no longer needed

5. **Control Devices**:
   - Turn devices on/off from the device detail view
   - Monitor immediate power consumption changes
   - Control multiple devices from the main dashboard

6. **Analyze Costs**:
   - View real-time cost calculations based on your rate structure
   - Track daily, monthly, and total electricity costs
   - Identify top energy consumers and usage patterns
   - Export data for further analysis

## Architecture

### Backend (Python/FastAPI)
- **FastAPI**: REST API and WebSocket support
- **python-kasa**: Communication with Kasa devices
- **SQLite**: Device information and configuration storage
- **InfluxDB** (optional): Time-series data for better performance
- **Socket.IO**: Real-time updates to frontend
- **APScheduler**: Periodic device polling

### Frontend (Next.js/React)
- **Next.js**: React framework with server-side rendering
- **TanStack Query**: Data fetching and caching
- **Recharts**: Interactive data visualization
- **Socket.IO Client**: Real-time data updates
- **Tailwind CSS**: Responsive styling

## Data Storage

### SQLite Tables:
- `device_info`: Device metadata
- `device_readings`: Historical power consumption data
- `electricity_rates`: Rate configurations
- `device_costs`: Calculated costs

### InfluxDB (Optional):
- Better performance for time-series queries
- Automatic data aggregation
- Retention policies for data management

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/devices` - List all discovered devices
- `POST /api/discover` - Trigger device discovery
- `GET /api/device/{ip}` - Get device details
- `GET /api/device/{ip}/history` - Get historical data
- `GET /api/device/{ip}/stats` - Get device statistics
- `POST /api/device/{ip}/control` - Control device (on/off)
- `GET /api/rates` - Get electricity rates
- `POST /api/rates` - Set electricity rates
- `GET /api/costs` - Calculate electricity costs

## WebSocket Events

- `device_update` - Real-time device data updates
- `subscribe_device` - Subscribe to specific device updates
- `unsubscribe_device` - Unsubscribe from device updates

## Troubleshooting

### Devices not discovered:
- Ensure devices are on the same network
- Check firewall settings for ports 9999 and 20002
- Try using TP-Link Cloud credentials for newer devices

### No power data:
- Not all Kasa devices support energy monitoring
- Ensure device firmware is up to date

### Database errors:
- Check file permissions for SQLite database
- Verify InfluxDB connection if configured
