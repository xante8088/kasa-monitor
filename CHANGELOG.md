### ‚ö† BREAKING CHANGES

* Remove redundant Docker build workflows

- Remove .github/workflows/docker-build.yml (redundant with CI/CD)
- Remove .github/workflows/docker-build-manual.yml (redundant with CI/CD)
- Update docker-build-pr.yml to use GitHub Container Registry consistently
- Consolidate all Docker builds into single CI/CD pipeline workflow

BENEFITS:
- Single registry: All images in GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io)
- No duplicate builds: CI/CD pipeline handles all production builds
- Quality gates: Images only built after tests pass
- Resource efficiency: No redundant CI/CD minutes usage
- Simplified maintenance: One comprehensive workflow instead of multiple

REMAINING WORKFLOWS:
- ci-cd.yml: Complete CI/CD pipeline (build/test/deploy/release)
- docker-build-pr.yml: PR validation builds only (no push)
- cleanup workflows: Image management and storage optimization

Updated documentation to reflect single registry approach and simplified workflow structure.
